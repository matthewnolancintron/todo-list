# make content fit
making content fit onto the page better




after looking over my html 
I realize it's pretty bad and could use some work
I could update a lot of class names to better match what
the markup is for but I would have to check through a lot
of scripts to see what will be affect and update the naming
in each .js file accordingly 

I could also update the HTML to be a little more sementic

eventualy I should also work on a11y stuff.


finished styling the section 1 of 2
for main content which is the
#todoLists-area, I could style 
the nested elements but I'm going to
leave them as is for now since 
I don't have anything in mind for them
and they look fine for now.

start styling #todos-area next
