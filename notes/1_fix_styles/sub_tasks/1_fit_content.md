# fixing layout 
making content fit onto the page better

can start using the diagrams to style to application
if need can create more diagrams for the subsections
nested in .addTodoFormcontainer


after looking over my html 
I realize it's pretty bad and could use some work
I could update a lot of class names to better match what
the markup is for but I would have to check through a lot
of scripts to see what will be affect and update the naming
in each .js file accordingly 

I could also update the HTML to be a little more sementic

eventualy I should also work on a11y stuff.
