Issues:
when a new list is created
todo items can't be placed or added to those lists
for some reason.
until a page refresh.

find the code that handles adding a new list
I checked local storge and the list seems to get added
but todo items can't get added to it try to find the
code for adding and moving todo items to then do some further
testing to narrow down the issues might have to do some sort
of update in that area.
